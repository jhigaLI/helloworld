I am using this file to solidfy my understanding
of git add/commit/push commands. I will then
edit this file on the origin remote (GitHub site)
and then confirm I can also use git pull to then
have these changes realized on my local branch.

The trial was a success! My other file, "testing gitadd..."
was also added. This gives me confidence in adding more than
one file at a time for commitment. This second paragraph
was edited from the origin remote (GitHub site). This file
will now be pulled from the origin to the local branch. This
is great!
